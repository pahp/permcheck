# permcheck
a step-by-step tester of the posix permissions lab

Work on the tasks described in the POSIX permissions lab.

When you want to check your progress, run:

`sudo ./progcheck.sh`

The script will quit on the first error, giving you a (hopefully) helpful hint about what to do.

Remember that there are short-answer questions assigned with this lab that you will have to do separately, and that this script can't grade.
