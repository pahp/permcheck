# permcheck
a step-by-step tester of the posix permissions lab

## installing

Clone this repository onto your `posix` node. To do that, do:

```
git clone https://github.com/pahp/progcheck
```

If `git` is not installed, first do:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

## instructions

Install the tool.

Work on the tasks described in the POSIX permissions lab.

When you want to check your progress, `cd` into the repository and run:

`sudo ./progcheck.sh`

The script will quit on the first error, giving you a (hopefully) helpful hint about what to do.

**TIP:** Keep a window open in this repository so that you can run `sudo ./progcheck.sh` whenever you want!

## important note

Remember that there are short-answer questions assigned with this lab that you will have to do separately, and that this script can't grade.

## troubleshooting

If you have any problems with the script, contact `pahp@d.umn.edu`.
