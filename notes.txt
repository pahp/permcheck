program should identify "old school" permissions tarball

then it should make 'etc' and move xyz into that directory

then all tests should be from the relative directory

all tests should use the groups and stuff from etc/passwd and etc/group

is there a way to always display the group number instead of name?
tests could use the number
errors could display the names
